Tab Navigation: I want a tab navigation bar at the top of the page with the following tabs:

Me

Projects

Skills

Resume

Contact

Each of these tabs should lead to a separate landing page or section when clicked. When a user clicks on a tab, they should be taken to the corresponding content (such as a new page or dynamically loaded content) within the same webpage.

Functionality for Each Tab:

Me Tab:

Clicking the "Me" tab should load a section that introduces who I amâ€”a brief bio about my background, career, and achievements.

The page should have a professional and personal description of my career, achievements, and expertise, including a high-quality image of me (or placeholder for now).

Projects Tab:

The "Projects" tab should show a detailed overview of all my ongoing and completed projects.

Each project should have a title, description, technologies used, and links to project demos or case studies.

The projects should be visually interactive, using hover effects or modals that provide more information when clicked.

Skills Tab:

The "Skills" tab should display a detailed breakdown of my professional skills in web development, copywriting, video editing, AI utilization, etc.

Use interactive icons for each skill that have hover effects and can be clicked to provide additional information about my expertise in each area.

The page should also feature a list of programming languages, tools, and technologies I am proficient in, with each skill having its own short description.

Resume Tab:

Clicking the "Resume" tab should display my resume, either as a downloadable PDF or in a visually appealing, scrollable format directly on the page.

Ensure the content of the resume is easy to read, with sections like Education, Work Experience, and Certifications clearly laid out.

Contact Tab:

The "Contact" tab should contain a contact form that allows visitors to send inquiries directly via email.

Include social media links and contact details such as email and phone number.

The contact form should be simple yet professional, including fields like Name, Email, Message, and a Send button.

Tab Navigation Implementation:

Ensure the navigation is sticky, remaining at the top of the page as users scroll through the website.

Use smooth scrolling so that when a user clicks on any tab, they are smoothly scrolled down to the corresponding content (no page reload).

The active tab should be visually indicated with a distinct color or highlight to show the user which section they are currently viewing.
